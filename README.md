# Formal Labs

This supplement has three purposes:

1. help me organize what to write on the whiteboard
2. help you quickly remember previous labs
3. give you a quick run-down in case you skipped a lab (hopefully not used very often)

Hopefully the third aspect is the least used one.

That being said, I *highly* encourage you **not to skip** any labs, and **attend** the lectures.
