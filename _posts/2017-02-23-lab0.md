This lab presents intuitive examples for the objects we'll use in this class.

Afterwards, academic and *real-world* uses are presented for each of them.



## Automaton Example

Keep the score of a tennis match between two players. It should start at `0/0` and end when one of the players reaches `40` points.

The automaton:

![tennis_automaton](assets/tennis_automaton.svg)

Each node is a **state** representing the score. `15/0` means the first player has `15` points and the second one `0`.

Each arrow is a **transition** from one state to another.

Each transition happens on an **event**. The first player `P1`  or the second one `P2` can score.

The game begins in the **starting state** `0/0`. No player has scored yet.

The game ends in one of the **final states**. Either `P1` or `P2` wins.



*Note:* For the sake of simplicity, we do not take into account draw events (`30/30`) which need further breaking.





## Regular Expression Example

Check valid email addresses. `example@mail.com` and `ex4mple@company.ro` should be valid while `person.com` and `name@me` should be invalid.

The regular expression:

$$
(l|d)+\ @\ \ l+\ .\ (com|ro)\\
l \in \left\{ a…z \right\}, \ \ d \in \left\{ 0…9 \right\}
$$

$l$ represents a letter (`a` to `z`).  $d$ represents a digit ( `0` to `9`).

$l\|d$ matches a letter *or* a digit.

$l+$ matches multiple letters (one or more).

$@$ and $.$ are just symbols from the email address.

Knowing this, we can now read the expression as:

- some letters or numbers
- followed by `@`
- followed by some letters
- followed by `.`
- followed by `com` or `ro`




*Note*: For the sake of simplicity, we only match alpha-numeric email addresses ending in either `.com` or `.ro`.



## Grammar Example

Decide if a sentence is correctly formed. `A dog drives a bus` and `A dog barks`  are correct but `Barks a bus` is not.

The grammar:

$$
\begin{align}
S & \rightarrow N V \\

N & \rightarrow N V \\

N & \rightarrow \text{dog} \ | \ \text{bus} \\

V & \rightarrow \text{drives} \ | \ \text{barks}
\end{align}
$$

A sentence has the **starting symbol** `S`.

It is made up of two **non-terminal** parts of speech: a noun `N` followed by a verb `V`.

A noun `N` can be **derived** into (rewritten as) a noun `N` followed by a verb `V`.

A noun can alternatively be derived into a **word**: `dog` or `bus`. A verb `V` can be either `drives` or `barks`.



*Note:* For the sake of simplicity, we ignore the preposition `a` and also semantically incorrect sentences such as `A bus drives a dog` or `A dog drives a bus drives a bus`.



## Theoretical Usefulness

Automata:

- basis for *Turing Machines*, used in proving the *calculability* and *complexity* of programs
- appear in *Artificial Intelligence* (RBMs or HMMs)

Regular Expressions:

- matching and extracting strings or other sequences
- alternative form of an Automaton

Grammars:

- compiler design



## Day-to-day Applicability

Automata:

- video game states
- character animation

Regular Expressions:

- extracting parameters from an url (eg: `id3` from `books.com/details/book_id3`)
- validating form input (eg: valid card number, name long enough etc)

Grammars:

- natural language queries (eg: `what's the weather today?`)
