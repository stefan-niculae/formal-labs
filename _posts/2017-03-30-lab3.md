# NFA to DFA

Starting from a NFA, build an equivalent DFA by removing nondeterministic-transitions.

The idea: from state $q$ if we can reach via `a` both $r$ and $s$:

- $q\xrightarrow{a}r$
- $r\xrightarrow{a}s$

We create a new *compound* state $rs$ that $q$ can reach via `a`

- $q\xrightarrow{a}rs$

The *compound* state $rs$ has the outward transitions of both $r$ and $s$.

Of course, this means we can have *up to* $2^n$ states — but in practice, most of them are junk states which we ignore.

## Original automaton

We will convert the following NFA:

Which accepts words ending in `ab` — language: $(a\|b){*}\ ab$. Example accepted words: `ab`, `bbbab`, `aabbbbaaab`. Transition table:


| $\delta$   |     a      |   b   |
| ---------- | :--------: | :---: |
| $\bf{q_0}$ | $q_0, q_1$ | $q_0$ |
| $\bf{q_1}$ |            | $q_2$ |
| $\bf{q_2}$ |            |       |

## Transition function

The table will have the same columns, `a` and `b`.

Start from the starting state $q_0$. Via `b` it can reach only itself — no non-determinism here, keep it the same. Via `a` it can reach both itself and $q_1$ — create a *compound* state labeled $q_{01}$.

> *Note*: a *compound* state is not a list of states. It is a single state which has a different label ($q_{01}$), as it is simpler for us to work with it. We could have labeled it $q_3$ or $q_a$ — a label that is not in the original automaton.


Add another row for each new state encountered: $q_0$ already exists so we add $q_{01}$.

$q_{01}$, via `a` can reach *everything* $q_0$ and $q_1$ can reach via `a`:

-  $\delta(q_0,a) = \langle q_0,q_1 \rangle$
-  $\delta(q_1, a)= \emptyset$
-  so $\delta'(q_{01},a) = q_{01}$


$q_{01}$, via `b` can reach *everything* $q_0$ and $q_1$ can reach via `b`:
-  $\delta(q_0,b) = \langle q_0 \rangle$
-  $\delta(q_1, b)= \langle q_2 \rangle$
-  so $\delta'(q_{01},b) = q_{02}$

Again, we add another row for each new state encountered: $q_{01}$ already exists so we add $q_{02}$.

After completing this row in the same manner, there are no new states encountered. No rows must be added — we finished the transition table.

| $\delta'$     |    a     |    b     |
| ------------- | :------: | :------: |
| $\bf{q_0}$    | $q_{01}$ |  $q_0$   |
| $\bf{q_{01}}$ | $q_{01}$ | $q_{02}$ |
| $\bf{q_{02}}$ | $q_{01}$ |  $q_0$   |


## Starting and accepting states

The starting state remains $q_0$.

A *compound* state is accepting iff one of the states in its label is accepting (in the original automaton). In our case, the original automaton had only one accepting state, $q_2$ which appears only in the label of state $q_{02}$.

## Converted automaton

We obtained a bigger automaton which *deterministically* accepts the same language $(a\|b){*}\ ab$

The states can be renamed without affecting functionality — $q_{01}$ to $q_1$ and $q_{02}$ to $q_2$.


|      $\delta_{renamed}'$ |   a   |   b   |
| -----------------------: | :---: | :---: |
|   $\rightarrow \bf{q_0}$ | $q_1$ | $q_0$ |
|             $\bf{q_{1}}$ | $q_1$ | $q_2$ |
| $\underline{\bf{q_{2}}}$ | $q_1$ | $q_0$ |
